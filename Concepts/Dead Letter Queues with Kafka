A DLQ(Dead Letter Queue) should allow listing for viewing the contents of the queue, puring for clearing those contents and merging 
for reprocessing the dead-lettered messages

Solutions :
	Processing in seperate queue:
		To address the problem of blocked batches, we set up a distinct retry queue using a separateðŸ¤¥ 
		defined kafka topic. When a consumer handler returns a failed response for a given message after 
		a certain number of retries, the consumer publishes that message to its corresponding retry topic
		The handler then returns true to the original consumer, which commits its offset.package Concepts
