### What is Lua?

Lua is a powerful and fast programming language that is easy to learn and use and to embed into your application.

Lua is designed to be a lightweighted embeddable scription language. It is used for all sorts of applications from games to web applications and image processing.

### File extension of lua file will be .lua
### To run lua file
    > lua main.lua 

```lua
    -- comment in lua
    --[[
        multi-line 
        comment
    ]]
    print("Hello World!");

    print("Hello" .. "Jack" .. "!" .. "My name is rahul.")
```

```lua
    -- define a factorial function
    function fact (n)
        if n == 0 then
            return 1
        else
            return n * fact(n-1)
        end
    end

    print("enter a number: ")
    a = io.read("*number") -- read a number
    print(fact(a))
```

A semicolon may optionally follow any statement. Usually, I use semicolons only to separate two or more statements written in the same line. but this is just a convention. Line breaks play no role in Lua's syntax;
#### Data Types
- nil
- number : 1 1.24 0.1 44
- string 'hello' "Hello world"
- boolean true false
- table

```lua
    local a -- local scope variable
    print(a) -- it will print nil

    local b = 2
    print(b + 5)

    local name = "Rahul"
    print("My name is ".. name .. ". I am 12 years old. I have decided that my name should 
    not be " .. name .." because the name " .. name .." sucks")

    local name = "jack"
    local surname = "smitter"
    local full_name = name .. " " .. surname
    print(full_name)

    local multiLineString = [[
        Colo
        Hello World
        Please
    ]]
    print(multiLineString)
``` 

You can also think of a box as a file, if you use multiple lua files in your program, then local variables can only be accessed in their respective files, but global scope variable can be accessed from outside the file, meaning your variable names my overwrite the variable name inside another file

```lua
    c = 20 -- global scope variable
```

```lua
    _G.Hello = "Hello"
    print(type(x))
```

### Math In LUA
```lua
    local str = "22"
    print(type(tonumber(str)))

```
